### Contains Duplicate

**Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that `nums[i] = nums[j]` and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.**


Example:

__Input__: nums = nums, k = 3
__Output__: true

```
const arr = nums;
const k = 3;

containsNearbyDuplicate(arr, k); //true
```
