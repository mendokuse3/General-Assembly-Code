# YUM!

For Warmup/ Walkthrough we will beautify this Restaurant and go over design patterns you can use in JSX and Express
## Setup
Run NPM I
## Express

Build out an app using Express with routes that you can view in your browser and forms that manipulate your data with full CRUD.

Your app should have one resource: Restaurants.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The name of the restaurant |
| owner | String | The name of the owner |
| type | String | The type of food the restaurant serves |
| capacity | Number | The max capacity of the restaurant |
