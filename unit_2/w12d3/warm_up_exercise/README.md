### Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example:

__Input__: `()`
__Output__: `true`

```
const str = "(()";

validParen(str); //true
```


### Longest Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing any characters between the numbers a-b and the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

__Input__: `(a()`
__Output__: `2`

__Explanation__: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()"


```
const str = "(a()";

longestValidParen(str); //2
```
