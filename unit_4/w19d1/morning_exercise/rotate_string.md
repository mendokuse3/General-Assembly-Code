# Rotate String

We are given two strings, `A` and `B`.

A shift on `A` consists of taking string `A` and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if `A = abcde`, then it will be `bcdea` after one shift on `A`. Return True if and only if `A` can become `B` after some number of shifts on `A`.


```js
Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false
```


- Note: Try answering this problem in either `Ruby` of `JavaScript`. When you answer the problem with one language, try answering it in the other.
