You can solve these problems using either Javascript or Ruby!



### Delete Operation for Two Strings

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

##### Example 1
```js
Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

**note:**

- The length of given words won't exceed 500.
- Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.


### 

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of `O(log n)`. (WHAT DOES THAT MEAN!?)

##### Example 1
```js
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

##### Example 2
```js
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
