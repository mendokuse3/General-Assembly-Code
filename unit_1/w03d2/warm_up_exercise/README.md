# Activity

## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](https://imgur.com/o06G8j2.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
1) Use your starter code from the previous class to continue working on this!

## Hungry For More?

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Style the site further to make it look more professional (e.g. style the navigation and footer links differently)!
3. If you didn't do the doggie mockup last time, do it now! If you did do the HTML mockup for it, but didn't get to the CSS, do it now!
