# Array Methods with Callbacks

A few array methods use callbacks. For example `.map` - `.map` takes each element of an array and does something to it and returns a new array.

But what should it do? Multiply everything by 5? Capitalize everything? If `.map` had a hard-coded thing it always did with an array, it wouldn't be very flexible.

By allowing a callback to determine what happens to each array element we get a lot of flexibility and we can do some really powerful things. 

Four Arrays to work with

```js
const smallNums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0]

const nums = [ 37, 826,209, 419, 309, 48, 738,709,728, 607, 9, 863, 976, 588, 611, 164,383, 261, 14, 525,479,169,755,574, 330,
  736, 541, 838, 577,957,179,436,333, 206, 295,744,926, 799, 691,259,401,104,630,645, 722, 607, 587, 714, 446, 356, 18, 16, 14, 5,
  13,13,17, 5, 5, 18, 12, 5, 18, 11, 2, 2,  9,  8, 4,5,18, 15,18,0,6,11,18,14, 2, 19, -14, 5, 18, 12, 3, 12, 7, 15, 5, 3, 12, 7, 6,
  10, 3, 3, 3, 18, 12, 14 ]

const panagram = ['The', 'quick','brown','fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']

const panagrams = [ 'The','job', 'requires', 'extra', 'pluck', 'and', 'zeal', 'from', 'every', 'young', 'wage', 'earner',  'Quick', 'zephyrs', 'blow,', 'vexing', 'daft', 'Jim', 'Two', 'driven', 'jocks', 'help', 'fax', 'my', 'big',
  'quiz', 'Five', 'quacking', 'zephyrs', 'jolt', 'my', 'wax', 'bed', 'The', 'five', 'boxing', 'wizards', 'jump', 'quickly', 'Pack',
  'my', 'box', 'with', 'five', 'dozen', 'liquor', 'jugs', 'We', 'promptly', 'judged', 'antique', 'ivory', 'buckles', 'for', 'the',
  'next', 'prize', 'Jaded', 'zombies', 'acted', 'quaintly', 'but', 'kept','driving','their','oxen','forward' ]
```

## Every

1. Determine if every number is greater than or equal to 0
1. determine if every word shorter than 8 characters

## Filter

1. filter the array for numbers less than 100
1. filter words that have an even length


## Find

1. Find the first value divisible by 5
1. find the first word that is longer than 6 characters


## Find Index
1. find the index of the first number that is divisible by 3
1. find the index of the first word that is less than 2 charaters long

## For Each
1. console.log each value of the nums array multiplied by 3
1. console.log each word with an exclamation point at the end of it

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `forEach` method in a new array?

## Map
1.  make a new array of each number multiplied by 100
1. make a new array of all the words in all uppercase

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `map` method in a new array?


## Reduce
- Add all the numbers in the array together using the `reduce` method
- concatenate all the words using reduce

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?

## Some
- Find out if some numbers are divisible by 7
- Find out if some words have the letter `a` in them

## Sort
- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the numbers array?
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- Sort the numbers in descending order
- Sort the words in ascending order
- Sort the words in descending order

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?

## Hungry for More

- filter for words that have at least two vowels in them
- find each instance of the word zephyr - include case insensitve and plurals (Zephyr, zephyrs, and Zephyrs), and list the index positions

- filter for products with a price that is less than 20, using the array below:

```
