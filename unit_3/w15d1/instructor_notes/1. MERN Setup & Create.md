# MERN Stack

An app built with Mongo, Express, React and Node is often referred to as using the MERN stack.

We've been building the back end and now it's time to build the React layer.

Going forward, we will use starter code to get our folders running. However, let's take it slow and look at our setup in our `server.js` file together to understand how we will make this file work for Client side rendering!

#### Stop and take a look at our current server.js file inside of express_api

We're going to be using the `index.html` in the `public` folder as our main entry point. We'll continue to use the script tags for React and Babel.

We will no longer be rendering our view server side. This means that we will not be using our controllers to render the view. Instead, we will be using our client to call an API that will expose our mongoose database. After retrieving  the data from this API via React on the front end, we will then display our data to the user. 

This is unlike `unit_2`. In the previous unit, we told express which file to render when a view was requested by the browser. Now, express will be smart enough to know to look in the public folder and find the index.html file. Since React will be attached to this file, we will have our `React` application appearing in the browser. 

We are keeping our tooling simple so it will be easy for you to host your project on Heroku. Tools like Webpack are great! But there is a lot to learn about them. In the interest of time, we'll focus on React and leave developer tools, development/production set up aside for now.

As you research on your own you'll see that, often, the backend server is separate from the client server - we'll do this in Unit 4.

If you haven't already  -

- `cd student_examples/express_api`
- `mkdir public`
- `cd public`
- `touch index.html`
- `mkdir css`
- `touch css/main.css`
- `mkdir js`
- `cd js`
- `touch app.js`
- `mkdir components`


**index.html**

```html

### Mock up

![base mock up](https://i.imgur.com/fbKM3zW.png)

We have ~ 3 components

- top level app that will have the
  - header
  - form
  - list

- form
  - input text
  - input submit

- todos
 - to do
 - delete to do
 - complete to do
 - will click or doubleclick item to edit it


But for simplicity, we'll just make one component with state. If we have some time left over we'll break our app into more than one component.


### Plan

- **Read** We'll start on rendering our todos. We've been building this app and testing it so we should have some items in there, if we don't we can use the command line to cURL at least one todo.
- **Create** Then  we will move on to creating new ToDos
- **Delete** We'll make a little x to click on that will delete our todo
- **Update Simple** - We'll click on the checkmark and set our todo as complete. We'll change the css of our completed todos.

Bonuses - if we have time/do as a lab:
- **Update w. Form** - We'll add a form to update one todo's text

- Break our app into  multiple components
