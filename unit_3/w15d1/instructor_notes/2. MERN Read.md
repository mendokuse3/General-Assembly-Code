We will want to populate our list with todos from our database.

We'll want to do it on page load. We can write a fetch request, similar to the ones we wrote for our third party APIs

```js
  fetch('/todos')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(todos => {
      console.log(todos);
    })
```

Where can we put this function so it gets called on page load?

There is the possibility of calling it in the `constructor`, however this is a bit dangerous, as this is asynchronous and there is no guarantee that the data response and the render will happen in the correct order.

Rather, we'll have to rely on a React lifecycle method called `componentDidMount()`. 

### Lifecycle Methods
In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts.

These methods are called “lifecycle methods”.

Lifecycle methods are methods that are triggered on certain events on a component, like when it is mounted on the page, or unmounted... and many more.

There are a few life cycle methods, but we are going to talk about 2 veryy important ones.

##### Render
We have already been using lifecycle methods! GO YOU! We have used render which does all the work. It returns the JSX of your actual component. When working with React, you’ll spend most of your time here.

##### ComponentDidMount
After we’ve rendered our component for the first time, this method is called.

If you need to load data, here’s where you do it. Doing AJAX in componentDidMount will guarantee that there’s a component to update.

In this method we can do all the setup you couldn’t do without a DOM, and start getting all the data you need.

```js 
componentDidMount() {
  fetch(...)
}
```

**Most Common Use Case for componentDidMount:**
Starting AJAX calls to load in data for your component.

For now, we'll just use this one method to make a fetch request on page load. It's important to note that this is a special built-in method and it must be spelled exactly.


Let's try it

```js
componentDidMount () {
  fetch('/todos')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(todos => {
      console.log(todos)
    })
}
```

We should see an array of our ToDos in our console.

Now we want to see our Todos. In `this.state`, we already added an empty array for todos. We can set our todos from our database to this.

```js
componentDidMount () {
  fetch('/todos')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(todos => {
      this.setState({
        todos: todos
      })
    })
}
```

Let's add a table to our component, later we'll add functionality to an  edit and a delete button, a table will help give us sensible vertical alignment

```js
<table>
  <tbody>
    {this.state.todos.map(todo => {
      return (
        <tr>
          <td> {todo.description} </td>
          <td> X </td>
          <td> complete </td>
        </tr>
      )
    })}
  </tbody>
</table>
```
